LEAP is a web application that generates a personalized learning path based on your educational background, skills, and goals. The app uses an AI model to create a customized plan and allows you to download it as a `.docx` file. Built using Python, Streamlit, and the GROQ LLM API, the application generates comprehensive learning paths with key concepts, curated resources, and estimated completion timelines. Features include automated document generation for learning plans, and intelligent resource recommendations from trusted platforms. The tool helps users efficiently plan their learning journey by breaking down complex career transitions into structured, actionable steps with specific time estimates and progress tracking capabilities.

# Features🌟
- Generates a customized learning path based on user input.
- Displays a timeline-style learning path.
- Allows users to download the learning path as a `.docx` file.

# Setting Up the Environment 
# Step 1: Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/gudashashank/LEAP

cd learning-path-generator

# Step 2: Create and Activate Virtual Environment
Create virtual environment:
python3 -m venv venv

Activate virtual environment (Linux/Mac):
source venv/bin/activate

Activate virtual environment (Windows):
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# Step 3: Install Required Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Step 4: Set up your environment variables
Create a .env file in the root of your project directory.
Add the necessary API keys or environment variables in the .env file. For example:

API_KEY=your-api-key-here


# Step 5: Make sure your .gitignore file is properly set up to ignore the .env file
Add .env to the .gitignore to prevent accidentally committing your API key to GitHub:

.env

# Step 6: Run the Application
streamlit run app.py
